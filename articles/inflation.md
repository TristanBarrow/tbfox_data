Money is like water in your cool-aid. The more water you have, the less flavor
you have. The more money there is, the less buying power you have. The federal
reserve literally prints money. Therefore, they directly control the amount of
water in the cool-aid.

Government can’t help but print and borrow money to buy support and basically
“buy” votes.

-   “Good government pays for education”
-   “Good government pays for healthcare”
-   “Good government pays for the homeless people”

With what money? The money they print and borrow at the expense of inflation and
the future citizens.

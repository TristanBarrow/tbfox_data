Clear and extensive naming conventions aimed at informing me about my code’s
structure have been indispensable in my career.

For example, I name all of my functions that make get requests
`get[Object]Request`. So if it is blog posts it would be `getBlogRequst` or
`getBlogsRequest`. Post requests I name `post[Object]Request`, etc… This type of
naming convention provides me with instant information about what the function
is doing in my system. I tend to play around with which conventions provide me
the most information before settling int a long term standard. Over time I’ve
built a system of naming conventions that provides instant feedback and
information without me needing to dig through a bunch of my code files. This is
one of many reasons I’ve been able to deliver new features in old codebases
quickly and safely.

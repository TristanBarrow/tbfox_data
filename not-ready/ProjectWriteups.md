# Project Write Ups

These are some interesting projects I have done over my scholastic and
professional career that have created the foundations of my professional
experience. Like many programmers I have a grave yard of un-finished or broken
projects that, while maybe are not currently useful, have provided me with
significant learning opportunities and experience over my career. This page is
simply a collection of links to the those write ups. Where I can write up some
information about what I learned while doing a particular project and how it is
applicable to my life.
